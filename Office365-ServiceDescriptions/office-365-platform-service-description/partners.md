As an authorized Microsoft partner, Microsoft Office 365 offers you an opportunity to grow your customer base and create lasting relationships with them. For a monthly or annual fee paid to you, your customers can use cloud-based services so they don't have to manage data backups, server hardware, and server updates. The services available to you depend on the types of services you are authorized to provide.
  
> [!NOTE]
> For more information on how to use partner features, see [Build your business and administer your Office 365 partner subscription](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=271614&amp;clcid=0x409) and review the partner features presentation. To receive access to the partner features, you can join Cloud Essentials by signing the [Microsoft Online Services Partner Agreement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=285473). 
  
## <a name="create-trial-invitations-and-purchase-orders"></a>평가판 초대 및 구매 주문 만들기

You can create and send trial invitations to your customers so they can try Office 365 by using the **Partner overview** page in Office 365. The invitation can contain one or more services, depending on the offer. If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add an option to the trial invitation that allows you to administer the account on behalf of your customer. This makes it easier for your customer to try Office 365. 
  
After you've sent a trial invitation for Office 365 to a customer, you can follow up by creating and sending a purchase offer that's customized to fit the needs of your customer including the specific services and the number of licenses your customer needs. If you're certified to offer delegated administration, you can add the option to the purchase offer that allows you to administer the account on behalf of your customer.
  
## <a name="provide-delegated-administration"></a>위임된 관리 제공

Delegated administration allows a partner to have full administrative access to all the customer's services and subscriptions. This means you can perform administrative tasks on behalf of customers (including setting up mailboxes, adding or removing users and groups, data migration, and submitting service requests to Microsoft Customer Service and Support). Delegated administration capability is offered exclusively for partners who are enrolled in Cloud Essentials, Cloud Accelerate or the Cloud Deployment programs.
  
Before you can start administering a customer's account, the customer must authorize you as a delegated administrator. To get customer approval, you send them an offer for delegated administration, which you can include with a trial invitation or purchase offer. The customer authorizes a Delegated Administration partner by responding to the partner's invitational email.
  
각 고객은 위임 된 관리 파트너를 하나만 가질 수 있습니다. 이 파트너는 또한 고객의 POR(공식 파트너)이 될 수도 있으나 필수 사항은 아닙니다. POR 및 위임된 관리 파트너의 역할은 구분되며, 고객은 이들 파트너를 별도로 지정합니다. 이 체계에 따라 고객은 구매 제안을 위한 파트너와 구현 및 관리 서비스를 위한 파트너를 따로 선택할 수 있습니다. 또한 파트너는 전문성에 따라 이러한 역할 중 하나 또는 둘 모두에 대한 비즈니스 추진 여부를 선택할 수 있습니다.
  
고객은 파트너에게 자신을 대신하여 관리 작업을 수행하도록 승인했더라도 Microsoft 지원 센터에 직접 연락하여 서비스 요청을 제출할 수 있습니다.
